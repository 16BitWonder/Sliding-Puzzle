To set up a custom puzzle, do the following:

1) Copy a 240x240 png image into this folder (It must be named "3x3.png")
2) Launch the 'Setup 3x3.jar' file
3) Wait for 'Setup 3x3.jar' to finish the images 1-9
4) Enjoy your custom puzzle!

Side Note:
You can technically use the 'Setup 3x3.jar' in
the regular '3x3' folder for another custom puzzle.
