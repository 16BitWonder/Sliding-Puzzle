# Sliding-Puzzle
Sliding-Puzzle is a homebrew game for the 3DS, made mostly in Lua with [LövePotion](https://github.com/videah/LovePotion).  
And partially with java, for the setup of custom puzzles.

- Debug 3x3 Slide-Puzzle (Can be enabled from main menu with L+R+B)
- All puzzle layouts randomized (Every time)
- Timer to keep track of time (On every puzzle)
- Jar executable and instructions in each of the custom puzzle folders to set up a custom theme (Folders Custom3x3, Custom4x4, and Custom5x5)

Controls:
- 'D-Pad' controls cursor movement on the main menu, when paused, and in every puzzle
- 'Start' pauses the current puzzle, and switches to the pause menu on the main menu
- 'A' selects an option when in a menu, and moves a puzzle piece (If it can be moved)

Issues:
